In typescript we can't use the same variable and assign multiple type of data types in it.
But in javascipt it is possible to do so. Like-
let money=500
money='Faisal khan Tushar'
in typescript we can't do things like that.

//things that we have covered here-
1.how to write variables in typescript without conflicting their types.
2.how to write functions with return value and no return value in typescprit.
